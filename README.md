# Delphi Sync Edit Button Hider
A simple utility that monitors for the Sync Edit button in Delphi (that causes HUGE slow downs in scrolling performance), and hides it.

Have you been using Delphi / C++ Builder / RAD Studio / AppMethod and been having *appauling* scrolling performance whenever you select some text?

Well this is your lucky day! Here's a utility which will target the handle of that crappy button and completely obliterate it from existance.
